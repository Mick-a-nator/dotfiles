## TODO/FIXME

 * Automate `terminfo` install. ___Because___ italics are not supported by default in MacOS/iTerm2, but are fixed with `terminfo` config.
 * Change install_nvim function. ___Because___ NeoVim apt package is an old version and does not work with many plugins & scripts.
 * Install a nerdfont. ___Because___ extra symbols/icons are needed for plugins. Currently the install is manual.
 * Fix chicken-and-egg problem of istalling/depending on plugins
